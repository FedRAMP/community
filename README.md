# Community Repository

This repository is for FedRAMP's two active community working groups that are open entirely to the public. These working groups interact in public on GitHub Discussions with bi-weekly summary recap sessions hosted on Zoom by FedRAMP.

## FedRAMP 20x

This group focuses on exploring how FedRAMP can rely on automated validations to the greatest extent possible, and simply documentation and management requirements by relying on existing best practices and commercial security frameworks.

## FedRAMP Rev5

This group focuses on grounding all Rev5 authorization and monitoring processes in modern security practices; revising and modifying the existing approach to enable commercial cloud providers to better deliver their services to the government.
